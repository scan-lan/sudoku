# Sudoku solver

This is a quick thing I coded to see if I could make an algorithm to solve sudoku grids.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `npm install`

## Running

To run a dev version, enter the following command. The app will run at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```zsh
npm run start
```
